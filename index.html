	<p>I was one of the founders of the <a href="http://www.berkeleysportsanalytics.org">Sports Analytics Group at Berkeley</a>. We have worked with professional teams including the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Sacramento Kings, the San Francisco Giants, and others. We've also done some pretty cool <a href="http://berkeleysportsanalytics.org/projects/"> projects</a>. You can reach us by <a href="mailto:sagberkeley@gmail.com"> email</a>.</p>

	<p>I put some of my projects up on my <a href="http://www.github.com/aripickar"> Github</a>, like a <a href="https://github.com/aripickar/fbbot"> messaging bot</a> I made to help with a friend's election. He won!
		I also made an Android app using Google Firebase that allows teachers to crowdsource school supplies, called <a href="https://github.com/aripickar/team-project-team03">TeacherMatch</a>.</p> 

	<p>I went to a couple of hackathons, and have taken a look at some cool stuff at them. I've built things like a model to predict AirBnb rental usage. You can find that <a href="UC_Berkeley_Data_Open.pdf">here</a>.</p>
